# Expanding-Cards
Built following 50 projects in 50 Days

<h2>Day One</h2>

<p>This was a simple little widget built using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by following Day 1 of 50 projects in 50 days Udemy course by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop, link will be below.</p>

<p>This allows a user to click and cycle through various cards that have images as a background. It also has a small header at the bottom of the card with text relating to the corresponding backgrond image.</p>

<p>Feel free to take this and use it as needed, customize it, style it, make it your own as it was created from a tutorial and is not my work. I may eventually come back and edit / change it to my own vision or needs at a later date.</p>
